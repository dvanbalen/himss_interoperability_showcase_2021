= HIMSS 2021 Sepsis Detection Demo

This catalog item provides you with a turn-key environment of Red Hatâ€™s _HIMSS 2021 Sepsis Detection Demo_ .

== Overview

Sepsis is a costly and life threatening condition resulting in multi-organ failure. Beating conditions like sepsis requires rapid detection and mitigation of risks. Recovery at home is often preferred, yet Medical teams often lack the capability to perform constant surveillance for emerging risks across their patient cohorts, especially in rural settings. We will demonstrate an early warning system driven by Clinical AI at the Edge, fed by at-home post-operative monitoring and automated Clinical care escalation and coordination processes.
